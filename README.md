# CoreWars

## Overview
CoreWars[1] is a game where two programs battle for control of a section of memory.
Combatants write programs in Redcode[2], and pit them against each other.
The first program to be eliminated from memory, or execute a null statement, loses.

## Bringing this to WoW
The desire to bring this to World of Warcraft[3] is solely for fun, and a challenge.
